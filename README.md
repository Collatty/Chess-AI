# How to run

Note that regardless of how you run it, the GUI is a bit buggy. You should click prefrences -> highlight legal moves 
in order to see when you have actually selected a piece to move. Also note that the move highlighter itself is a bit 
buggy. it does for instance not highligh castling as a legal move, although you will be able to perform the move.

To play the AI, click options and choose the player you want to be played by the computer. 

#### Alternative 1:

Clone my repository and open in your favorite editor. Run the main class `Chess`found at 
src/main/java/com/collatty/chess/Chess.java.

#### Alternative 2: 

Download/open the file named `collatty-chess.jar` found in the root folder of this repository. Run the file on your 
computer. You need JDK 11 to run the jar. This can be downloaded [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html).
To run from command line navigate to where the jar is located and run "java -jar collatty-chess.jar".




# About

This was created as part of Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - 02180 - at DTU. The program is made from 
scratch, but I followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOJzCFLZdG4zk5d-1_ah2B4kqZSeIlWtt) playlist, as
 it would have
 taken forever to complete this without any help.
 
 The program is not bug free, but the worst bugs should have been handled. Feel free to create a pull request with fixes
 if you feel like doing so.
