# About

This was created as part of Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - 02180 - at DTU. The program is made from 
scratch, but I followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOJzCFLZdG4zk5d-1_ah2B4kqZSeIlWtt) playlist, as
 it would have
 taken forever to complete this without any help.
 
 The program is not bug free, but the worst bugs should have been handled. Feel free to create a pull request with fixes
 if you feel like doing so.
